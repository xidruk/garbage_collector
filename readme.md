# garbage_collector

A lightweight, efficient garbage collector written in C/C++ using low-level memory control with `mmap`. Designed to work seamlessly with high-level languages, this project demonstrates custom memory management by automatically reclaiming unused memory and simplifying resource handling.

## Features

- **Custom Memory Allocation:** Uses `mmap`/`munmap` for direct memory control.
- **Automatic Memory Reclamation:** Provides a foundation for building a garbage collector that reduces manual memory management.
- **Cross-Language Integration:** Easily extendable for embedding in high-level language runtimes.
- **Simple & Minimal:** A clean, easy-to-understand implementation for educational purposes and further enhancements.
